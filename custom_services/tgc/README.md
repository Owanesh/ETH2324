# The green crusaders
Welcome to our Capture The Flag (CTF) blog app built with Next.js using App Router. This project serves as a simple blog platform where users can read articles and log in using static credentials. We've designed it to be self-contained, with no external services called, making it perfect for CTF challenges.

# 📝 Usage
## 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies with the power of pnpm, the superhero of package management.

## 🚀 Development
Start the development server by running `pnpm dev`. Watch your code come to life as you make changes, all thanks to pnpm's lightning-fast build process.

## 🌐 Deployment
For deployment, simply build your project with `pnpm build`, then deploy the generated files to your preferred hosting provider or use `pnpm start`. 

# 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities

Please note that there are intentional vulnerabilities present in this codebase, which will be explained in more detail later. These vulnerabilities are included to provide a learning opportunity for participants of the CTF. We encourage you to explore the code, identify these vulnerabilities, and learn how to mitigate them to improve your web development skills.
