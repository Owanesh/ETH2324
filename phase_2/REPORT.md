# Troubleshooting
As `/etc/netplan` configuration of the machine says, there is a static ip address without DHCP. It's look weird and agains requirements of the assignment.
![[Screenshot 2024-05-03 at 08.37.24.png]]
For this purpose we decide to boot the machine in recovery mode and then enable `root` console, only for network managment.
Once `root` we have removed every file under /etc/netplan and then we've created a `/etc/rc.local` file with following code
```sh
#!/bin/bash
dhclient
exit 0
```
then `chmod 755 /etc/rc.local` and then, enable and restart the service (may take a while)
```sh
systemctl enable rc-local
systemctl restart rc-local
```

### FTP
Since nMap shows us an anonymous login allowed on machine, try to explore..
```sh
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ ftp 192.168.56.2
    anonymous
    <blank_password>
```
![[Screenshot 2024-05-03 at 09.55.32.png]]
`site-credentials.txt` reports something like
```txt
In case you forget the credentials to upload the files on the website,the IT department provided me with a file containing the password.
They mentioned a certain MD5 code.

ftp-user 37b4e2d82900d5e94b8da524fbeb33c0
```
seems we have a password hashed with MD5, but.. MD5 is unsafe since 2008 then maybe a rainbow-table attack can "decode" it.

```sh
md5:37b4e2d82900d5e94b8da524fbeb33c0 -> football
```
then.. could be this a user of the system? try it.
```sh
‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ ssh ftp-user@192.168.56.2
    football
ftp-user@ubuntulab:~$
```

Try to understand what are last operation of ftp-user by reading his **.bash_history** file
```sh
ftp-user@ubuntulab:~$ cat .bash_history
ls
cd ..
ls
cd ..
sl
ls
exit
systemctl start apache2
systemctl status apache2.service
journalctl -xe
sudo journalctl -xe
exit
ls
exit
cat /etc/crontab
nano ../scripts/health_check.sh
vi ../scripts/health_check.sh
less ../scripts/health_check.sh
```
in his `/home` there are some files, maybe useful for priviledge escalation
```sh
ftp-user@ubuntulab:/usr/local/apache24/cgi-bin$ ls
printenv  printenv.vbs	printenv.wsf  test-cgi
```
try to execute `printenv`
```sh
ftp-user@ubuntulab:~$ ./printenv
